  				<h3>Re:Serve Cancellation Policy</h3>
  				<p>
  					
  					When you make a reservation at a restaurant with your Reserve account, you agree to honor the reservation by arriving on time with your party and dining at the restaurant. We understand that plans can change, so if you need to change or cancel your reservation, please do so at least 30 minutes in advance to avoid having a “No-Show” associated with your Reserve account.

  					Some restaurants also have their own cancellation policies, which may include fees for cancellations or no-shows. You will be able to view any restaurant-specific cancellation policies before you request or book your reservation, but please note that by submitting a request or booking the reservation you are also agreeing to the restaurant’s policies.

  					Reserve has access to great tables because we give our restaurants peace of mind that our diners will arrive. We reserve the right to suspend accounts with multiple “No-Shows” or late cancellations.
